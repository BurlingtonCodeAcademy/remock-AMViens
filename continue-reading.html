        <p>
          Clock strikes twelve and moon drops burst
          Out at you from their hiding place
          Like acid and oil on a madman's face
          His reasons tends to fly away
          Like lesser birds on the four winds
          Like silver scrapes in May
          Now the sands become a crust
          And most of you have gone away
          Come Susie dear, let's take a walk
          Just out there upon the beach
          I know you'll soon be married
          And you'll want to know where wind comes from
          Well it's never said at all
          On the map that Carrie reads
          Behind the clock back there you know
          At the Four Winds Bar
          Four
        </p>
        <p>
          winds at the Four Winds Bar
          Two doors locked and windows barred
          One door left to take you in
          The other one just mirrors it
          Hey!Hey!Hey!Hey!
          Hellish glare and inference
          The other one's a duplicate
          The queenly flux, eternal light
          Or the light that never warms
          Yes the light that never, never warms
          Yes the light that never, never warms, never warms, never warms
          The clock strikes twelve and moondrops burst
        </p>
        <p>
          Out at you from their hiding place
          Miss Carrie Nurse and Susie dear
          Would find themselves at Four Winds Bar
          It's the nexus of the crisis
          And the origin of storms
          Just the place to hopelessly
          Encounter time and then came me
          Hey!Hey!Hey!Hey!
          Call me Desdinova
          Eternal light
          These gravely digs of mine
          Will surely prove a sight
          And don't forget my dog
          Fixed and consequent
          Astronomy - a starOut at you from their 
          hiding place Miss Carrie Nurse and Susie dear

        <h4>
          Hell and Back
        </h4>
        <p>
          There's nowhere else I can run to 
          She's wretched but she comforts me
          After everyone goes home
          She's always there for me When the sun goes hell bound
          And the moon does resurrect the night
          I'll hide within her
          Not much good has come out of the light
          After everyone goes home And I'm left here on my own
          I will run straight to Hell and back
        </p>
        <p>
          When they turn out all their lights
	        And I'm left to brood at night
          Always return to Hell and back
          Straight to Hell and back
	        Straight down A lonely light in a window
          Just longing for some company
          Tragic, heartless and hateful
          But there's nothing as willing as she
          And when the night has fallen
          It falls hard and then it all begins
          When she starts her calling
          I feel my darkness growing from within
          After everyone goes home
	        And I'm left here on my own
          I will run straight to Hell and back
          And I'm left here on my own
          I will run straight to Hell and back
          And I'm left here on my own
          I will run straight to Hell and back
          And I'm left here on my own
        </p>
        <h4>
          No Leaf Clover
        </h4>
        <p>
          And it feels right this time
          On his crash course with the big time
          Pay no mind to the distant thunder
          New day fills his head with wonder, boy
          Says it feels right this time
          Turned it 'round and found the right line
          "Good day to be alive, sir
          Good day to be alive," he says
          Then it comes to be that the soothing
          light at the end of your tunnel
        </p>
        <p>
          Was just a freight train coming your way
	        Then it comes to be that the soothing light at the end of your tunnel
          Was just a freight train coming your way
          Don't it feel right like this?
          All the pieces fall to his wish
          "Sucker for that quick reward, boy
          Sucker for that quick reward," they say
          Then it comes to be that the soothing light at the end of your tunnel
          Was just a freight train coming your way
          Then it comes to be that the soothing light at the end of your tunnel
          Was just a freight train coming your way
          It's coming your way
          Then it comes to be that the soothing light at the end of your tunnel
          Was just a freight train coming your way
