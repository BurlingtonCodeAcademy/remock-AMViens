          So close no matter how far
          Couldn't be much more from the heart
          Forever trusting who we are
          And nothing else matters
          Never opened myself this way
          Life is ours, we live it our way
          All these words I don't just say
          And nothing else matters
          Trust I seek and I find in you
          Every day for us something new
          Open mind for a different view
          And nothing else matters
          Never cared for what they do
	        Never cared for what they know
          But I know So close no matter how far

          Until it sleeps...
        </h4>
        <p>
          Where do I take this pain of mine?
          I run, but it stays right by my side
          So tear me open, pour me out
          There's things inside that scream and shout
          And the pain still hates me
          So hold me until it sleeps
          Just like the curse, just like the stray
          You feed it once and now it stays
          Now it stays So tear me open but beware
          There's things inside without a care
          And the dirt still stains me
        </p>
        <p>
          So wash me until I'm clean It grips you, so hold me
		      It stains you, so hold me
		      It hates you, so hold me
          It holds you, so hold me Until it sleeps
          So tell me why you've chosen me
          Don't want your grip Don't want your greed
          Don't want it I'll tear me open, make you gone
          No more can you hurt anyone
          And the fear still shakes me
          So hold me until it sleeps
          It grips you, so hold me It stains you, so hold me
		      It hates you, so hold me It holds you, holds you, holds you
          Until it sleeps I don't want it
          So tear me open but beware
          There's things inside without a care
          And the dirt still stains me
          So wash me... till clean
          I'll tear me open, make you gone
          No longer will you hurt anyone
          And the hate still shapes me
          So hold me until it sleeps Until it sleeps
